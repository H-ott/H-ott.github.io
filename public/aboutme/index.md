# Hello, Iâ€™m Duc Dat Dau.

Iâ€™m a hacker/security researcher from VietnamÂ ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³

During the day, I learn about cybersecurity at my university. At night and in my free time, I research IoT hardware, learn techniques to hack Linux kernel or write exploits for vulnerabilities. Sometimes, I play CTF with theÂ [TAS.DihydroMonoxide](https://ctftime.org/team/351063).

I plan to graduate in 2026 and am open to pursuing an MS or PhD if given the opportunity. This is my resume. Please let me know if it meets your requirements. Regards.
